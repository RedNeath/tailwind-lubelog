Self-Hosted, Open-Source, Web-Based Vehicle Maintenance and Fuel Mileage Tracker; Tailwind stylised fork of LubeLogger. Note that this is still a work-in-progress (more about that [here](https://github.com/RedNeath/tailwind-lubelog/wiki)).

LubeLogger Website: https://lubelogger.com

## Why
Because nobody should have to deal with a homemade spreadsheet or a shoebox full of receipts when it comes to vehicle maintenance.
